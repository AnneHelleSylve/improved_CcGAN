We create cell dataset with different number of cells, the whole dataset can be found in cell_dataset/ directory.

This code is based on software: http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/csb/simcep/tool.html 
 
To generate the cell dataset, please go to simcep/generate_cell_dataset_cGAN.m 

Here we generate cell images with cell number ranges from 1 to 300. 

For each cell number, we have 1000 image samples.  

To run the code, first run:

1)run make_simcep in the command window to compile the C file;

2)run generate_cell_dataset_cGAN.m
